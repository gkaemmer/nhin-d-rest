Caveats: I haven't fully integration tested this
TODO.txt for a rough plan for what needs to be done here.

==Installation==

I run this off my OS X laptop, so this should run on a Snow Leopard machine.

I have yet to pull onto bare metal Linux or Windows -- let me know.

===Prerequisites==

Ruby with Gem support
Sqlite3


===Installation tasks===
gem install rails mongrel

cd nhin-d-rest/rails

rake gems:install
rake db:migrate
rake db:test:load
rake test:integration

=Overview=

All the juicy bits are in routes.rb, messages_controller.rb and messages.rb
